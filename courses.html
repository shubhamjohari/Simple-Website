                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
                HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
                An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by .
                <!--"<" and ">"-->
                The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture.

        <h1><br> CSS </h1>
            <div class = css>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
                CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized across Web browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS 2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.
                With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text â€” one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

        <h1><br> BootStrap</h1>
        <div class = bootstrap>
         Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.Additionally, Bootstrap requires jQuery to function. jQuery is an extremely popular and widely used JavaScript library, that both simplifies and adds cross browser compatibility to JavaScript.

        Everything else you might happen across while studying the Bootstrap documentation - Grunt, Gulp, Sass, LESS, bower, npm, etc - is not necessary to get started with Bootstrap. These are task runners, preprocessors, installation aids, and package managers, so don't be discouraged if you don't know how to use any of them yet.

        <h1><br>PHP</h1>
        <div class = php>
        PHP is a server side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.

        PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.

        The client computers accessing the PHP scripts require a web browser only.

        A PHP file contains PHP tags and ends with the extension ".php".
            PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML code or binary image data. PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.
